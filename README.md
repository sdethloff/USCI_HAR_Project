# USCI_HAR_Project

This repository contains a single R script which produces a tidy data set from Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Using Smartphones - data furnished by University of California Irvine (UCI). This data was collected by way of a smartphone enabled inertial sensors which measured subjects during typical activity. More information on the study and data source can be found here: [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones]

# Goal
Coursera, in collaboration with Johns Hopkins University, offers a course in Getting and Cleaning Data, which requires students to obtain an clean data to a "Tidy" state, then summarize that in defined way. This project is the final requirement of this course.

# Requirements

Download the data for the project, found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Repo Files Description

Enclosed in this repo, you will find four files including the README.md described herein, CodeBook.md which describes a technical and detailed description of the code with supporting definitions, the script, run_analyis.R, which creates the tidy dataset, and the summary tidy set, har_means.txt.
